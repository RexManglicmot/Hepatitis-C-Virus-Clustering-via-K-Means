## Status: Continuing Working Document

Things to do/Questions:

* why does the functions summary() and colMeans() have different outputs for the mean?

Blood is very important as it is used for in medical procedures. Patients will need blood for surgical procedures (i.e., heart transplant or car crash trauma), or if someone has an underlying blood-related disease (i.e., anemia). As such, Twenty-one million of blood components are transfused in the US/year.^[https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/what-happens-to-donated-blood/blood-transfusions/reasons-transfusions.html#:~:text=Blood%20transfusions%20are%20a%20very,in%20the%20United%20States%20alone.] 

Organizations like the American Red Cross have championed the notion for people to donate their blood^[https://www.redcrossblood.org/]. It is therefore important to classify which blood is suitable for transfusion. 


The target attribute for classification is Category (blood donors vs. Hepatitis C (including its progress ('just' Hepatitis C, Fibrosis, Cirrhosis).

All attributes except Category and Sex are numerical. The laboratory data are the attributes 5-14.

1) X (Patient ID/No.)
2) Category (diagnosis) (values: '0=Blood Donor', '0s=suspect Blood Donor', '1=Hepatitis', '2=Fibrosis', '3=Cirrhosis')
3) Age (in years)
4) Sex (f,m)
5) ALB
6) ALP
7) ALT
8) AST
9) BIL
10) CHE
11) CHOL
12) CREA
13) GGT
14) PROT


## Loading the Libraries
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(stats)
library(factoextra)

```



## Loading the Data
```{r}
#laod data into an url object
url <- ('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00571/hcvdat0.csv')

#put data into an object
data_orig <- read.csv(url)

#view strucuture
str(data_orig)
```

## Cleaning the Data
```{r}
#make copy for cleaning
data <- data_orig

#view any NAs
sum(is.na(data))

#which rows have NAs
which(is.na(data), arr.ind = TRUE)
```


```{r}
#create dataset to compare with Kmeans that has no NAs
data_orig2 <- data_orig %>%
  drop_na()

#clean data all in one go
data <- data %>%
  #get rid of variables that are not needed for Kmeans via dplyr
  select(-c(X, Category, Sex)) %>% # will try dataframe$column <- NULL next time
  #rename columns to lower case
  rename_all(tolower) %>%
  #deletes NAs
  drop_na()
```

Let's Explore

## Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r}
#show summary statistics of data
summary(data)
```


```{r}
ggplot(gather(data, cols, value), aes(x = value, fill=cols)) + 
       geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(.~cols, scales = 'free') + 
  theme_calc() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

```{r}
ggplot(gather(data, cols, value), aes(x = value, fill=cols)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(.~cols, scales = 'free') + 
  theme_calc() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") 
```

```{r}
ggplot(gather(data, cols, value), aes(x = value, fill=cols)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(.~cols, scales = 'free') + 
  theme_calc() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") 
```


## K-Means



```{r}
#save the labels
data_orig2.labels = data_orig2$Category

#standardize all columns and store into new object
data1 <- data %>%
  mutate_all(~(scale(.) %>%
  as.vector))

#check of the mean is 0
summary(data1)

#colMeans(data1) --> this gives different output? why?

#check if the sd is 1
apply(data1, 2, sd)
```

```{r}
# #kmeans and k=5 since there are 5 categories in the dataset
# kresult <- kmeans(data1, 5)
# 
# print(kresult)
```
Insights:

* 5 clusters
* Means of each cluster in each feature

```{r}
# #let compare 
# table(data_orig2$Category, kresult$cluster)
```

```{r}
# calc disance between observations
data_dist <-dist(data1)

#calc how many clusters needed via an elbow plot
#method is within Sum Sqaures (wss)
fviz_nbclust(data1, kmeans, method = 'wss') +
  labs(subtitle = 'Elbow Method')
```

We know that there are 5 clusters of groups. However, when we are looking at elbow plot (to find the optimal number), we need to look at diminishing returns and the slope is near zero. Here, it is difficult to tell, but I think from 4-5 looks good. Let's choose 5. 

```{r}
#kmeans with sclaed data, # of centers, and how many random sets to be chosen with nstart
kmeans <-kmeans(data1, center=5, nstart=100)

print(kmeans)
```

```{r}
#plot this bad boy!
# kmeans_clusters <- kmeans$cluster
# rownames(data1) <- data_orig2$Category
```
